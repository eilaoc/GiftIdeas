# GiftIdeas
Gift idea generator

A research project into different forms of NLP methods and their applications.

Amazon Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset/data?select=All+Exercise+and+Fitness.csv

Some stopwords I used - https://gist.github.com/sebleier/554280


- An idea to make it easier to tell what some products are is to include the category, some product names aren't very descriptive
- But this might not be useful because we're looking for general ideas anyway so less descriptive names will get filtered out
Need to think of ideas like "Power supply for Xbox 1", current model would only do "power supply"
Could be added in afterwards based on user inputs? eg if they like gaming could say "power supply for games console" as an example

Next steps:
- Make a larger dataset of gift ideas
- Find a way to filter these based on criteria (start small)
- Get more gifts from other sources (find new datasets)
- Make frontend for user to input these things
- Make more inputs for more accurate
- Product link
